This repository documents my journey of mastering LangChain v0.3 in JavaScript, with a focus on Generative AI application development.
I am exploring step-by-step concepts like:

🔹 Prompt Templates – Structuring dynamic prompts for better model responses.

🔹 Output Parsers – Extracting clean, structured outputs (JSON, numbers, text).

🔹 Function Calling & Tools – Enabling models to call external functions/APIs.

🔹 Runnables – Building modular AI pipelines for chaining tasks.

🔹 Integrating Gemini API – Using Google’s Gemini models for text generation, reasoning, and function calling.

🔹 End-to-End Projects – Building real-world AI apps (chatbots, assistants, and API-driven tools).

This repo will contain:
📘 Notes, 📝 Example Codes, and 🚀 Mini Projects — everything I build while learning.

Goal: To gain hands-on expertise in LangChain + Gemini AI and become confident in building production-ready AI applications.
